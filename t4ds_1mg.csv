Discovering and maintaining links on the web of data,"['Julius Volz', 'C. Bizer', 'M. Gaedke', 'Georgi Kobilarov']",2009,384,"The Web of Data is built upon two simple ideas: Employ the RDF data model to publish structured data on the Web and to create explicit data links between entities within different data sources. This paper presents the Silk --- Linking Framework, a toolkit for discovering and maintaining data links between Web data sources. Silk consists of three components: 1. A link discovery engine, which computes links between data sources based on a declarative specification of the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked; 2. A tool for evaluating the generated data links in order to fine-tune the linking specification; 3. A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources. The protocol allows data sources to exchange both linksets as well as detailed change information and enables continuous link recomputation. The interplay of all the components is demonstrated within a life science use case.","['link', 'data', 'source', 'Web']"
Object-oriented web application development,"['H. Gellersen', 'M. Gaedke']",1999,185,"Most Web applications are still developed ad hoc.

Interoperability in internet of things: Taxonomies and open challenges,"['Mahda Noura', 'Mohammed Atiquzzaman', 'M. Gaedke']",2018,209,"In the last few years, many smart objects found in the physical world are interconnected and communicate through the existing internet infrastructure which creates a global network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT). Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.","['IoT', 'interoperability', 'infrastructure', 'device', 'platform', 'solution']"
WebComposition: an object-oriented support system for the Web engineering lifecycle,"['H. Gellersen', 'Robert Wicke', 'M. Gaedke']",1997,136,"Maintenance of web applications is a difficult and error-prone task because many design decisions are not directly accessible at run time, but rather embedded in file-based resources. In this paper we introduce the WebComposition system addressing this problem. This system is based on a fine-grained object-oriented web application model, and maintains access to it throughout the lifecycle for management and maintenance activities. Modifications of the model are made effective in the web by incrementally mapping the model to file-based resources.","['model', 'web', 'filebased', 'access', 'design', 'finegrained', 'introduce', 'addressing', 'effective', 'maintains', 'resource', 'application', 'errorprone', 'problem', 'WebComposition', 'accessible', 'Maintenance', 'objectoriented', 'time', 'task']"
A modeling approach to federated identity and access management,"['M. Gaedke', 'J. Meinecke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2005,41,"As the Web is increasingly used as a platform for heterogeneous applications, we are faced with new requirements to authentication, authorization and identity management. Modern architectures have to control access not only to single, isolated systems, but to whole business-spanning federations of applications and services. This task is complicated by the diversity of today's specifications concerning e.g. privacy, system integrity and distribution in the web. As an approach to such problems, in this paper, we introduce a solution catalogue of reusable building blocks for Identity and Access Management (IAM). The concepts of these blocks have been realized in a configurable system that supports IAM solutions for Web-based applications.","['IAM', 'solution', 'block', 'application']"
Mockup-driven development: providing agile support for model-driven web engineering,"['J. Rivero', 'J. Grigera', 'G. Rossi', 'Esteban Robles Luna', 'Francisco Montero Simarro', 'M. Gaedke']",2014,68,"Context: Agile software development approaches are currently becoming the industry standard for Web Application development. On the other hand, Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) methodologies are known to improve productivity when building this kind of applications. However, current MDWE methodologies tend to ignore important aspects of Web Applications development supported by agile processes, such as constant customer feedback or early design of user interfaces. Objective: In this paper we analyze the difficulties of supporting agile features in MDWE methodologies. Then, we propose an approach that eases the incorporation of well-known agile practices to MDWE. Method: We propose using User Interface prototypes (usually known as mockups) as a way to start the modeling process in the context of a mixed agile-MDWE process. To assist this process, we defined a lightweight metamodel that allows modeling features over mockups, interacting with end-users and generating MDWE models. Then, we conducted a statistical evaluation of both approaches (traditional vs. mockup-based modeling). Results: First we comment on how agile features can be added to MDWE processes using mockups. Then, we show by means of a quantitative study that the proposed approach is faster, less error-prone and still as complete as traditional MDWE processes. Conclusion: The use of mockups to guide the MDWE process helps in the reduction of the development cycle as well as in the incorporation of agile practices in the model-driven workflow. Complete MDWE models can be built and generated by using lightweight modeling over User Interface mockups, and this process suggests being more efficient, in terms of errors and effort, than traditional modeling in MDWE.",
Development and evolution of web-applications using the webcomposition process model,"['M. Gaedke', 'G. Gr√§f']",2001,56,From a software engineering perspective the World Wide Web is a new application platform. The implementation model that the Web is based on makes it difficult to apply classic process models to the development and even more the evolution of Web-applications. Component-based software development seems to be a promising approach for addressing key requirements of the very dynamic field of Web-application development and evolution. But such an approach requires dedicated support. The WebComposition Process Model addresses this requirement by describing the component-based development of Web-applications. It uses an XML-based markup language to seamlessly integrate with existing Web-standards. For the coordination of components the concept of an open process model with an explicit support for reuse is introduced. By describing application domains using domain-components the process model addresses the need for a controlled evolution of Web applications.,"['process', 'support', 'approach', 'describing', 'development', 'requirement', 'address', 'Webapplications', 'software', 'model', 'Web', 'application', 'evolution']"

Exploiting single-user web applications for shared editing: a generic transformation approach,"['M. Heinrich', 'F. Lehmann', 'T. Springer', 'M. Gaedke']",2012,55,"In the light of the Web 2.0 movement, web-based collaboration tools such as Google Docs have become mainstream and in the meantime serve millions of users. Apart from established collaborative web applications, numerous web editors lack multi-user support even though they are suitable for collaborative work. Enhancing these single-user editors with shared editing capabilities is a costly endeavor since the implementation of a collaboration infrastructure (accommodating conflict resolution, document synchronization, etc.) is required. In this paper, we present a generic transformation approach capable of converting single-user web editors into multi-user editors. Since our approach only requires the configuration of a generic collaboration infrastructure (GCI), the effort to inject shared editing support is significantly reduced in contrast to conventional implementation approaches neglecting reuse. We also report on experimental results of a user study showing that converted editors meet user requirements with respect to software and collaboration qualities. Moreover, we define the characteristics that editors must adhere to in order to leverage the GCI.","['editor', 'approach', 'collaboration', 'web', 'user', 'infrastructure']"
Supporting compositional reuse in component-based Web engineering,"['M. Gaedke', 'J√∂rn Rehse']",2000,33,"The World Wide Web‚Äôs anticipated scope as an environment for knowledge exchange has changed dramatically. Without major modifications to its primary mechanisms the Web has turned into a platform for distributed applications. The originally simple and well-defined coarse-grained implementation model of the Web now hinders Web application development. Fine-grained development artifacts, design patterns, and other well-established Software Engineering methods are hard to reuse in the Web after they have found their way into implementation resources. The application of Software Engineering practice to development for the Web, which is also referred to as Web Engineering, and especially the systematic reuse of components for Web-application development at low-costs is a main goal to achieve. This paper explains how the object-oriented and component-based WebComposition Markup Language (WCML) addresses these problems. A systematic approach to code reuse is presented with the WebComposition Repository, which is an essential tool for retrieval and classification of large component sets. The Repository‚Äôs architecture is crafted to support multiple representation and classification approaches. It facilitates reuse in component-based Web Engineering.","['Web', 'reuse', 'Engineering', 'development', 'application']"
Web content delivery to heterogeneous mobile platforms,"['M. Gaedke', 'M. Beigl', 'H. Gellersen', 'Christian Segor']",1998,47,"It is widely acknowledged that information such as web content should be adapted for mobile platforms to account for restrictions in mobile environments. As emerging mobile platforms such as different kinds of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) tend to vary largely in their capabilities, we suggest that adaptation should be platform-specific. Common approaches for content adaptation are automated conversion and explicit specification of adapted content, with a trade-off between quality and development/maintenance effort. As alternative avoiding this trade-off, we propose a simple object-oriented framework for content adaptation. To facilitate the use of this framework in the Web, we base our approach on the object-oriented WebComposition model and its XML-based implementation WCML. We apply our object-oriented approach to an example application to demonstrate how object-oriented specification of platform-adapted content reduces development/maintenance effort.","['objectoriented', 'approach', 'content', 'specification', 'platform', 'effort', 'mobile', 'adaptation']"

We introduce the WebComposition system addressing this problem. This system is based on a fine-grained object-oriented Web application model. Services are logical units or business processes represented as groups of WebComposition components. The automatic creation for this class of components is possible using service factories, which are modeled on creational design patterns. Service factories enhance the planning for the evolution of the overall structure of large-scale Web sites.

WCML: Paving the way for reuse in object-oriented web engineering,"['M. Gaedke', 'Christian Segor', 'H.

Due to the legacy of the Web implementation model the development, management, and evolution of complex Web applications suffer from the coarse-grained model-entities. The demands can not be achieved without the application of programming technology and software engineering practice to applications in the Web, which is also referred to as Web Engineering. It has been recognized that the gap between design models and the implementation model of the Web leads to a development process that is hard to maintain, because fine-grained design entities get lost in the coarse-grained implementation model. Therefore, the coarse-grained implementation model hinders the maintenance and reuse of parts of an application. In this paper, the impacts on Web Engineering due to the coarse-grained Web implementation model are discussed and typical solutions that are related to the above problems are introduced. Then, the object-oriented WebComposition Markup Language will be presented as basis for a generic approach to component-based Web-application development.","['Web', 'model', 'implementation', 'application', 'coarsegrained', 'development']"
Web composition with WCAG in mind,"['V. L. Centeno', 'C. D. Kloos', 'M. Gaedke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2005,23,"Accessibility should be a part of the Web design process instead of being a post-design repair process. Thus, it should be more integrated within the internal authoring tools' mechanism of generating new accessible Web contents. Web pages are usually composed of small pieces of HTML code which, dynamically nested and combined, generate full Web pages. This Web composition, specially when creating Web pages from data extracted from heterogeneous or external sources, should have accessibility into account in order to guarantee that the final page being constructed is accessible. This paper presents the set of rules that, in a Web composition process, a design tool must follow in order to create accessible Web pages. These rules are formalized with W3C standards like XPath and XQuery expressions. We also present WSLS as an accessibility enabled authoring tool that makes this task feasible, and focus in how this tool incorporates accessibility into the process of generating new Web contents.","['Web', 'process', 'accessibility', 'rule', 'generating', 'authoring', 'composition', 'tool', 'accessible', 'design']"
Ensuring web interface quality through usability-based split testing,"['Maximilian Speicher', 'A. Both', 'M. Gaedke']",2014,23,"Usability is a crucial quality aspect of web applications, as it guarantees customer satisfaction and loyalty. Yet, effective approaches to usability evaluation are only applied at very slow iteration cycles in today‚Äôs industry. In contrast, conversion-based split testing seems more attractive to e-commerce companies due to its more efficient and easy-to-deploy nature. We introduce Usability-based Split Testing as an alternative to the above approaches for ensuring web interface quality, along with a corresponding tool called WaPPU. By design, our novel method yields better effectiveness than using conversions at higher efficiency than traditional evaluation methods. To achieve this, we build upon the concept of split testing but leverage user interactions for deriving quantitative metrics of usability. From these interactions, we can also learn models for predicting usability in the absence of explicit user feedback. We have applied our approach in a split test of a real-world search engine interface. Results show that we are able to effectively detect even subtle differences in usability. Moreover, WaPPU can learn usability models of reasonable prediction quality, from which we also derived interaction-based heuristics that can be instantly applied to search engine results pages.","['engine', 'usability']"

Automatic Knowledge Extraction to Build Semantic Web of Things Applications.,"['Mahda Noura', 'A. Gyrard', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M.

However, IoT suffers from a lack of interoperability leading to a substantial threat to the predicted economic value. Schema.org provides semantic interoperability to structure heterogeneous data on the Web. An extension of this vocabulary for the IoT domain (iot.schema.org) is an ongoing research effort to address semantic interoperability for the Web of Things (WoT). To design this vocabulary, a central challenge is to identify the main topics (concepts and properties) automatically from existing knowledge in IoT applications. We designed knowledge extraction for the WoT (KE4WoT) to automatically identify the most important topics from literature ontologies of three different IoT application domains: 1) smart home; 2) smart city; and 3) smart weather‚Äîbased on our corpus consisting of 4500 full-text conference and journal articles to utilize domain-specific knowledge encoded within IoT publications.

Exploiting annotations for the rapid development of collaborative web applications,"['M. Heinrich', 'Franz Josef Gr√ºneberger', 'T. Springer', 'M.

However, implementing collaborative real-time applications like Google Docs requires specific concurrency control services (i.e. document synchronization and conflict resolution) that are not included in prevalent general-purpose frameworks like jQuery or Knockout. Hence, developers have to get familiar with specific collaboration frameworks (e.g. ShareJS) which substantially increases the development effort. To ease the development of collaborative web applications, we propose a set of source code annotations representing a lightweight mechanism to introduce concurrency control services into mature web frameworks. Those annotations are interpreted at runtime by a dedicated collaboration engine to sync documents and resolve conflicts. We enhanced the general-purpose framework Knockout with a collaboration engine and conducted a developer study comparing our approach to a traditional concurrency control library.

The A/B Testing method is already widely used in web interaction design, but it utilizes a single measurable goal and therefore risks random undirected modifications in the interface `phenotype', since its `genotype' is not distinguished. Also, purely interactive assessment of the potentially defective solutions' fitness by real users is undesirable, so the neural networks-based Kansei Engineering (KE) method is increasingly used for fitness evaluation. We reason that KE can be extended to consider any kinds of requirements, not just the emotional aspect, and outline the relevant techniques. Further, as an interface abstract model corresponds to a genotype, we propose a dedicated domain ontology to represent the genome, i.e. the structure of the design space.

Yet, the models depend on the layout of the search results page involved, which makes them difficult to evaluate and compare. Thus, we use a Random Mouse Cursor as an extension to our pipeline for generating layout-dependent baselines. Based on these, we can perform evaluations of real-world relevance models. A large-scale interaction log analysis showed that we can learn relevance models whose predictions compare favorably to predictions of an existing state-of-the-art click model.","['model', 'relevance', 'interaction', 'prediction', 'click', 'compare', 'user', 'pipeline']"
Data binding for standard-based web applications,"['M. Heinrich', 'M. Gaedke']",2012,10,"Development frameworks have proven to drive developer productivity and flourish in a variety of different application domains. For example, data binding frameworks supporting the process of associating User Interface (UI) elements and data objects can reduce implementation efforts significantly. Even so desktop application developers have access to a myriad of data binding frameworks (e.g. Eclipse JFace); Web development still lacks decent data binding framework support.
 Therefore, we devised a WebSocket-based Data-binding (WebSoDa) framework which is capable of easing the cumbersome and error-prone task of coupling UI elements with their respective data objects. Besides providing a Microdata-based data binding language, the WebSoDa framework embraces the WebSocket protocol. We show that the network traffic in data binding scenarios can decrease considerably by applying a WebSocket-based framework instead of a conventional AJAX approach.","['framework', 'data', 'binding', 'WebSoDa', 'UI', 'developer', 'WebSocketbased', 'object', 'application']"

Selecting the right amount of virtualized resources for an application in such an environment is not an easy task and requires the utilization of three strongly interconnected resource management areas: resource modeling, resource estimation and resource discovery & selection. Most solutions enable an accurate selection of the most appropriate virtual resource package for specific application types already. Support for arbitrary applications, however, is rarely considered which means approaches in this area are usually not applicable for general use cases and, more importantly, difficult to compare with each other. We analyze the most promising existing research in resource management and examine monitored values, supported application classes and the most important criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach. We identify key similarities and differences as well as open research challenges.

However, we argue that the practical goal is not necessarily measuring a website's usability, but rather improving its quality-in-use or assessment by search engines' respective algorithms. Thus we outline benefits of evolutionary algorithms for website design, in which candidate solution fitness function calculation can effectively combine interaction-, metric-, and model-based approaches towards usability evaluation.","['usability', 'website', 'engine', 'evaluation']"
Smartcomposition: a component-based approach for creating multi-screen mashups,"['M. Krug', 'Fabian Wiedemann', 'M. Gaedke']",2014,16,"The spread and usage of mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, increases continuously. While most of the applications developed for these devices can only be used on the device itself, mobile devices also offer a way to create a new kind of applications: multi-screen applications. These applications run distributedly on multiple screens, like a PC, tablet, smartphone or TV. The composition of all these screens creates a new user experience for single as well as for several users. While creating mashups is a common way for designing end user interfaces, they fail in supporting multiple screens. This paper presents a component-based approach for developing multi-screen mashups, named SmartComposition. The SmartComposition approach extends the OMELETTE reference architecture to deal with multiple screens. Furthermore, we enhance the OMDL for describing multi-screen mashups platform independently. We draw up several scenarios that illustrate the opportunities of multi-screen mashups. From these scenarios we derive requirements SmartComposition needs to comply with. A huge challenge we face is the synchronization between the screens. SmartComposition solves this through real-time communication via WebSockets or Peer-to-Peer communication. We present a first prototype and evaluate our approach by developing two different multi-screen mashups.

Modeling Federations of Web Applications with WAM,"['J. Meinecke', 'M.

Particularly, these applications can reside under the control of different organizations. In this case, the Web is actually used as a means for establishing federations between the organizations behind their technical systems. This enables creating integrated business processes and thus facilitates seamless cooperation between multiple businesses. Naturally, the construction of such solutions raises specific concerns that go beyond traditional approaches, including questions of access control, identity management and evolution in the context of federation. Emerging federation specifications like WS-federation or liberty alliance are now offering standardized protocols as solutions to some of these problems. Along with the technological base, the process of establishing and operating federations also requires dedicated models to plan and describe the systems on an architectural level. Conventional approaches to modeling software in general and Web applications in particular do not specifically focus on federated architectures. For that purpose, we propose the Webcomposition architecture model (WAM), a modeling formalism based on our experience on developing federations of Web applications as well as the concepts found in recent federation specifications.","['federation', 'specification', 'concept']"

Web engineering revisited,"['E. Wilde', 'M. Gaedke']",2008,12,"Web Engineering has become one of the core disciplines for building Web-oriented applications. This paper proposes to reposition Web engineering to be more specific to what the Web is, by which we mean not only an interface technology, but an information system, into which Web-oriented applications have to be embedded.

We propose ""Web Engineering 2.0"" to not focus anymore on how to engineer for the Web, but how to engineer the Web. Such an approach to Web engineering not only leads to a more disciplined way of engineering the Web, it also allows computer science to better integrate the special properties of the Web, most importantly the loosely coupled nature of the Web, and the importance of the social systems driving the Web.",

Therefore, the barriers to entry for end users without technical experience should decrease. However, so far, research in the WoT has been mainly dedicated to technical aspects of smart objects such as communication challenges and interoperability. The benefits of WoT can be amplified if end users; who do not have the required programming skills, are provided the opportunity to be directly involved in defining the behavior of their smart environment without being involved in technical issues. Many of the current end user development (EUD) applications available for WoT are not efficiently usable for the non-technical users, requiring a high learning burden and high development time for the end user.

As a result, it is easy to obtain different evaluation results when different evaluation tools are applied to a common sample page. However, accessibility rules can be better expressed formally and declaratively in rules that assert conditions over the markup. We have found that XSLT can be used to represent templates addressing many accessibility rules involving the markup of Web pages. Even more, we have found that some specific conditions relaying in the prose of the XHTML specification not previously formalized in the XHTML grammar (the official DTD or XML Schemas) could also be formalized in XSLT rules as well.

This can be achieved by extracting the core concepts from the emerging Federation technologies and specifications and formalize them to an extent that they can be used as a foundation for configurable applications and services. In this paper, we introduce a solution catalogue of reusable building blocks for Identity and Access Management (IAM). We also present a configurable system that supports IAM solutions in Web-service-based applications.","['application', 'Web', 'support', 'solution']"
Aspects of service‚Äêoriented component procurement in web‚Äêbased information systems,"['M. Gaedke', 'J. Meinecke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2005,6,"Modern information systems are increasingly built on Web‚Äêbased and component‚Äêbased platforms. This raises the need for a service‚Äêoriented infrastructure to simplify the management and procurement of corresponding components. Special focus lies on the deployment and distribution of such software artifacts within the context of the World Wide Web to promote their reuse and there‚Äêfore to save development costs. At the same time, the integrity of the overall system must not be neglected. The use of components from third‚Äêparty vendors poses a potential security threat requiring additional care. Furthermore remains the issue of usage rights for the components and the data they provide. Flexible mechanisms can offer a huge range of different licensing models to be enforced on the runtime process. This paper presents an approach to deal with these challenges together with an implementation of a software system supporting component‚Äêbased Web portals.","['component', 'component‚Äêbased']"
Web intelligence linked open data for website design reuse,"['Maxim Bakaev', 'V. Khvorostov', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M.

Domain-specific design reuse on the web has especially high potential, saving work effort for thousands of developers and encouraging better interaction quality for millions of Internet users. In our paper we perform pilot feature engineering for finding similar solutions (website designs) within Domain, Task, and User UI models supplemented by Quality aspects. To obtain the feature values, we propose extraction of website-relevant data from online global services (DMOZ, Alexa, SimilarWeb, etc.) considered as linked open data sources, using specially developed web intelligence data miner. The preliminary investigation with 21 websites and 82 human annotators showed reasonable accuracy of the data sources and suggests potential feasibility of the approach.",

The design and evolution of federated systems calls for models that give an overview of the structural as well as trust-specific composition and reflect the technical details of the various accesses.

Therefore, it would be desirable to infer a quantitative usability score directly from implicit feedback, i.e., the interactions of users with a web interface. As a basis for this, we require an adequate usability instrument whose items form a usability score and can be meaningfully correlated with such interactions. Thus, we present Inuit, the first instrument consisting of only seven items that have the right level of abstraction to directly reflect user behavior on the client. It has been designed in a two-step process involving usability guideline reviews and expert interviews.

Moreover, high-level solutions intended to boost productivity of API development (usually based on Model-Driven Development methodologies) are often difficult to adapt to specific use cases and requirements. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows capturing requirements related to APIs using end-user-friendly artifacts. These artifacts allow quickly generating a first running version of the API with a specific architecture, which facilitates introducing refinements in it through direct coding, as is commonly accomplished in code-based Agile processes.","['APIs', 'requirement', 'methodology', 'development', 'application', 'process', 'solution']"

The decisive criterion here is not necessarily the amount of data available, but smart content techniques that promote not only the collection and accumulation of related data, but also its context, and understanding. This requires discovering associations between the data, prioritizing results, finding useful insights, discovering patterns and trends within the data to reveal a wider picture that is more relevant to the problem in hand and react to them. Smart Industrial-Strength Applications are a new generation of software applications that combine the benefits of smart data and advanced analytics to help organisations manage their resources (including humans), data, processes and systems more efficiently. Smart Data and Application innovations promise to bring greater speed and efficiency to industries as diverse as smart agriculture, smart cities, smart tourism, and smart health care delivery where they provide meaningful insights to decision makers and help them solve complex problems. They hold the promise of stronger economic growth, better and more job creation and rising living standards. This talk will focus on the role, characteristics, potential of smart data and applications for diverse domains, and their enabling technologies. To illustrate the potential of smart data and applications, the talk will draw on examples that highlight the interplay of medical and technical aspects of smart healthcare applications. Smart healthcare involves deploying computing, information, service, sensor and visualisation technologies to aid in preventing disease, improving the quality of care and lowering overall cost. The talk will also examine the design and deployment requirements, particularly for point-of-care medical applications, which emerge from the interplay of the actual clinical situation and the novelty of the smart healthcare application.

WAEX: Web Accessibility Evaluator in a single XSLT file,"['V. L. Centeno', 'C. D. Kloos', 'M. Gaedke', 'M.

Monolitic applications built on top of procedural programming languages like C, Java, Perl or PHP have been developed during the last years. These applications usually provide their own interpretation of the W3C guidelines, so it is easy to obtain different evaluation results when different evaluation tools are applied to a common sample page. Since most accessibility rules are involved with the markup of Web sites and XSLT can be applied to any selectable-by-condition markup, we have developed WAEX as a Web accessibility evaluator in a single XSLT file. Such XSLT file contains 50+ singular accessibility rules and XHTML-specific conditions that are in the prose of the XHTML specification because they could not be included in the grammar specification (the DTD or the XML Schemas). This approach of using XSLT as a declarative repository of accessibility rules has lead to a portable and reusable style sheet that generates rather complete (if compared with already existing evaluation tools) accessibility reports for any Web page","['accessibility', 'Web', 'XSLT', 'rule', 'evaluation', 'site', 'file', 'markup']"

A web engineering approach to model the architecture of inter-organizational applications,"['J. Meinecke', 'M. Gaedke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2005,4,"During recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW, Web) has in- creasingly been used as a platform for applications that link together processes both between and across organizations. Acting as distributed components, Web Services provide a standardized way of externalizing functionality on a global scale and as such enable accesses that transcend organizational boundaries to form federated applications. The design and evolution of these federated appli- cations is now imposing new obligations for the disciplined engineering of composed Web solutions. To meet these obligations, we extend the WebCom- position idea, which is an approach to apply component-based software devel- opment concepts on Web applications. This extension facilitates modeling the complex landscape of the components and services building the federated ap- plications. In this context, we introduce the WebComposition Architecture Model that serves as a map to keep track of the interrelations between the fed- erated partners in terms of the involved Web-technology. Among the modeled artifacts are Web services, Web Applications and organizational zones of con- trol that are all subject to evolution in the sense of the WebComposition ap- proach. The rise of network technologies has enabled many fields of applications and ways to support businesses. Initially applied to connect only distributed components within single companies, it is nowadays increasingly used to link together systems of multi- ple enterprises for the purpose of cooperation and federation. The resulting applica- tions are therefore characterized by their component-oriented architecture and distrib- uted nature. This trend has also been influenced by recent advances in Web technologies, par- ticularly in the field of Web services. In the context of enterprise integration, the ser- vice can take the role of the component in a distributed system by exposing function- ality and data through defined interfaces and standardized Web protocols. The value they provide can then be used in applications from within as well as from outside the company. In order to facilitate their orchestration to higher-level services, solutions can rely on business-process engines that control the execution flow of multiple ser- vices based on formal descriptions of the process.","['Web', 'service', 'manager', 'enables', 'generic', 'M2', 'requires', 'technology', 'depth', 'seamless', 'specification', 'system', 'computing', 'Managing', 'federation', 'basis', 'standard', 'connected', 'management', 'environment', 'managertomanager']"

Planning is intended as the ability of a WoT system to construct a sequence of actions, that when executed by the smart devices, achieves an effect on the environment in response to an end user issued goal. The problem of planning specifically for the WoT domain has not been sufficiently dealt with in the existing literature. The existing planning approaches do not deal with one or more of the following important factors in the context of WoT: (1) random unexpected events (2) unpredictable device effects leading to side effects at runtime, and (3) durative effects. In this work, we propose a cyclic planning system which adopted a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) process solution to deal with the existing shortcomings for continuous improvement. The planner employs domain knowledge based on the WoTDL (Web of Things Description Language) ontology.The cyclic planner enables continuous plan monitoring to cope with inconsistencies with user issued goals.

Data portability using Webcomposition/Data grid service,"['Emmanuel Syrmoudis', 'Stefan Mager', 'Sophie Kuebler-Wachendorff', 'Paul Pizzinini', 'Jens Grossklags', 'Johann Kranz']",2021,4,"Abstract Data portability regulation has promised that individuals will be easily able to transfer their personal data between online service providers. Yet, after more than two years of an active privacy regulation regime in the European Union, this promise is far from being fulfilled. Given the lack of a functioning infrastructure for direct data portability between multiple providers, we investigate in our study how easily an individual could currently make use of an indirect data transfer between providers. We define such porting as a two-step transfer: firstly, requesting a data export from one provider, followed secondly by the import of the obtained data to another provider. To answer this question, we examine the data export practices of 182 online services, including the top one hundred visited websites in Germany according to the Alexa ranking, as well as their data import capabilities. Our main results show that high-ranking services, which primarily represent incumbents of key online markets, provide significantly larger data export scope and increased import possibilities than their lower-ranking competitors. Moreover, they establish more thorough authentication of individuals before export. These first empirical results challenge the theoretical literature on data portability, according to which, it would be expected that incumbents only complied with the minimal possible export scope in order to not lose exclusive consumer data to market competitors free-of-charge. We attribute the practices of incumbents observed in our study to the absence of an infrastructure realizing direct data portability.","['Web', 'service', 'manager', 'enables', 'generic', 'M2', 'requires', 'technology', 'depth', 'seamless', 'specification', 'system', 'computing', 'Managing', 'federation', 'basis', 'standard', 'connected', 'management', 'environment', 'managertomanager']"
FDX: federating devices and web applications,"['M. Gaedke', 'J.

Currently, there is a tendency towards a combined application of individual gadgets that are connected within locally confined environments via a diversity of protocols and technologies like UPnP, WLAN and Bluetooth. As one step further in this direction, there is the vision of devices that are globally and uniformly connected through the WWW, extending the Mobile Web to a Ubiquitous Web. Hence, this allows for scenarios where actions on one device can trigger events on an arbitrary other device, and where third-party Web services from anywhere in the world are involved. Ultimately, this results in federations of devices and Web services belonging to different households, companies, suppliers and service providers, forming new kinds of Web applications that integrate devices as an additional dimension. To fulfill this vision, solutions are required that are able to abstract from the different device implementations and bridge the gap between the device and the Web. In this paper, we present the Federated Device Assembly (FDX) approach that offers an integrated management platform for wrapping and as such connecting arbitrary devices to enable new forms of Web applications along with the means to model such federations.

Based on the findings we made from our recent prototype we identify several problems and describe how we deal with them. We illustrate a way to achieve cross-platform real-time synchronization using several transport protocols. We propose the usage of sessions to handle multi-user, multi-screen scenarios and introduce techniques for new interaction and customization patterns.

Therefore, we propose a dependency injection mechanism using declarative annotations to incorporate concurrency control services into web applications. Instead of adopting comprehensive libraries or implementing application-specific components, synchronization capabilities are integrated in a lightweight and rapid fashion.

The capability of such systems rises with the number of available components. Hence it is advisable to facilitate their deployment and exchange with a supporting architecture. The achieved increased use of third party components also results in higher risks for the provider of the portal.

Here, we present the Automated Water Supply Model (AWSM) that streamlines and standardizes the workflow of a physically based snow model to create fully reproducible model simulations that can be utilized by researchers and operational water resource managers. AWSM orchestrates four core components that historically required significant, ad-hoc modeler interaction to load the input data, spatially interpolate to the modeling domain, run the models and process the outputs. Because AWSM was developed using principles and techniques from software engineering, users can quickly perform reproducible simulations on any operating system, from a laptop to the cloud. The three fully reproducible example case studies showcase the simplicity and flexibility of using AWSM to perform simulations from small research catchments to simulations that aid in real time water management decisions.",
Utilizing architecture models for secure distributed web applications and services,"['Stefan Wild', 'M.

While it allows promptly responding to change by adjusting the Web application architecture, security must be applied as a holistic approach throughout the entire Web application's lifecycle. There is a need for a flexible, expressive and easy-to-use way to model a Web application's architecture with a strong emphasis on security.

This prognostic study included Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 237,259) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania enrolled between 2015 and 2018, randomly divided into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 290 potential predictors (239 derived from Medicaid claims data) in 30-day periods, beginning with the first observed Medicaid enrollment date during the study period. Using a gradient boosting machine, we predicted a composite outcome (i.e., fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose constructed using medical examiner and claims data) in the subsequent month. We compared prediction performance between a Medicaid claims only model to one integrating human services and criminal justice data with Medicaid claims (i.e., integrated model) using several metrics (e.g., C-statistic, number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score decile subgroups. The samples (training = 79,087, testing = 79,086, validation = 79,086) had similar characteristics (age = 38¬±18 years, female = 56%, white = 48%, having at least one overdose = 1.7% during study period). Using the validation sample, the integrated model slightly improved on the Medicaid claims only model (C-statistic = 0.885; 95%CI = 0.877‚Äì0.892 vs. C-statistic = 0.871; 95%CI = 0.863‚Äì0.878), with small corresponding improvements in the NNE and positive predictive value. Nine of the top 30 most important predictors in the integrated model were human services and criminal justice variables. Using the integrated model, approximately 70% of individuals with overdoses were members of the top risk decile (overdose rates in the subsequent month = 47/10,000 beneficiaries). Few individuals in the bottom 9 deciles had overdose episodes (0-12/10,000).

To cope with the increased complexity of today's Web-based systems, approaches facilitating development, operations and evolution of these heterogeneous and distributed systems are vital. The approach, presented in this contribution, is based on a dedicated information model allowing the description of the overall system and its components characteristics. At runtime, the relevant model information is processed and provided to different in the system's lifecycle involved stakeholders and supports them to fulfill their activities. Due to this use in terms of orientation and guidance, our approach is called the Integrated Information Map (i¬≤map). Furthermore, the descriptive information regarding the nominal status and behavior of the components is used for automated monitoring and testing to assure the quality of the overall system at deployment and throughout operations.",
Components for growing the RESTful enterprise,"['Andreas Heil', 'J. Meinecke', 'M. Gaedke']",2008,1,"For a modern enterprise, it is vital to be on the Web. Beyond offering human-readable Web sites, organizations increasingly use the Web as a media for machine-readable data about itself. With the help of technologies like XML feeds, RESTful Web services and semantic markup, new forms of enterprises models emerge in a bottom-up way. These models are easily consumable and facilitate the interaction with departments, partners and customers. Engineering good publishing systems is however extremely challenging. On the one hand, knowledge of many technologies is required; on the other hand, it must be easy to extend systems and data models in accordance to agile businesses. In this paper, we propose a framework of components for publishing dynamically growing enterprise models on the Web, present an implemented system and discuss its use in a case study.",
Web composition with accessibility in mind,"['V. L. Centeno', 'C. D. Kloos', 'M. Gaedke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2006,1,"Web accessibility should be a part of the Web design process instead of being a post-design repair process. Thus, it should be more integrated within the internal authoring tools' mechanism of generating new accessible Web contents. Web pages are usually composed of small pieces of HTML code which, dynamically nested and combined, generate full Web pages. This Web composition, specially when creating Web pages from data extracted from heterogeneous or external sources, should have accessibility into account in order to guarantee that the final page being constructed is accessible. This paper presents the set of rules that, in a Web composition process, a design tool must follow in order to guarantee that the Web pages being generated are accessible. These rules are formalized with W3C standards like XPath and XQuery expressions (so they are vendor-neutral). We also present WSLS as an accessibility enabled authoring tool that makes this task feasible, and focus on how this tool incorporates accessibility into the process of generating new Web contents.",
Web engineering: introduction to Minitrack,"['M. Gaedke', 'D. Schwabe', 'G. Rossi', 'H. Gellersen']",2000,2,"The Web has evolved into a global environment addressing all kinds of application delivery, ranging from small-scale and short-lived services to large-scale, enterprise workflow systems distributed over many servers. The design, implementation, maintenance respectively evolution, and federation of such Web applications requires the application of software engineering practice, specifically as the life-cycle of Web applications is dramatically influenced by arising technologies, user-behavior, and state-of-the-art trends in electronic commerce. Nevertheless most of today's Web application development is still ad-hoc, which may result from the Web's legacy as a coarse-grained, document-centric information system rather than an application platform. Furthermore, the navigational metaphor intrinsic to the Web opens up new ways of managing huge information spaces, and the way users interact with applications to perform a task. Because the Web implementation model does not relate well to state-of-the-art software development models, it is rather difficult to define frameworks that enable the construction of Web Information System applications, reuse design knowledge captured in design patterns, or bridge the gap between a design model and the Web implementation model. This problematic was recently referred to as Web Crisis indicating that the lack of a structured approach will restrict the process of developing or federating more complex systems in the Web relating to cost reduction and quality improvement. In the recent years, this ‚Äúwebexperience‚Äù in the Hypermedia and Web community evolved into a new discipline called Web Engineering. Thus, Web Engineering focuses on the evolution of a profound engineering process and dedicated technologies, methods, and models for the development and maintenance of Web-applications. The Minitrack consists of five papers that cover a broad range of aspects concerning Web Engineering: In ‚ÄúTowards a Relationship Navigation Analysis‚Äù Yoonhee Yoo and Michael Bieber discuss the importance for determining the relationships within conceptual domains or implementations. Thus, they introduce the Relationship Navigation Analysis for system analysis, which is based on a generic relationship taxonomy and provides a systematic way of identifying useful relationships in application domains. German and Cowan investigate many design patterns of the Web community in ‚ÄúTowards a unified catalog of hypermedia design patterns‚Äù. They analyze the vocabularies and taxonomies of design patterns for the Web that are in use today and propose to rewrite the patterns using a uniform vocabulary. Markus Schranz, Johannes Weidl, and Stefan Zechmeister argue in ‚ÄúEngineering Complex World Wide Web Services with JESSICA and UML‚Äù that complex Web services are comparable to large software systems. Therefore, the management and engineering process requires dedicated methodologies and processes. The authors introduce the use of the object-oriented language JESSICA and its support by the Uniform Modeling Language UML. They demonstrate the use of the engineering system with a real world application. In their paper ‚ÄúA Schema-Based Approach to Web Engineering‚Äù Christoph Kuhnke, Andreas Turk, and Josef Schneeberger present a tool that supports their process model for publishing. They suggest the separation of content, layout, navigation, and structure for Document Engineering. This discipline focuses on document design, authoring, and production, and is seen as a methodology of Web Engineering. In ‚ÄúUsing Finite State Machines as Design and Engineering Model for Database Backed Web Applications‚Äù Karl M. G√∂schka and J√ºrgen Falb examine the use of hyperlink for user interaction with relational databases. They present an approach using finite state machines as basis for modelling dynamically generated hyperlinks, which in turn are used to interact with databases.

Yet we would argue that not everything changes but that a large proportion of design decisions are of lasting quality. We propose that such design decision be captured explicitly through complimentary use of design patterns in design methods, and illustrate this with the use of patterns in the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method (OOHDM). Further, we propose the use of an object-oriented web implementation technology, the WebComposition Markup Language (WCML), to facilitate straightforward mapping of object-oriented design patterns to an implementation, and so to facilitate the tracking of higher-level design decisions in a web implementation.",
NAND-measure: An Android App for Marker-based Spatial Measurement.,"['Maik Benndorf', 'Maximilian Jugl', 'T. Haenselmann', 'M. Gaedke']",2021,1,"In a disaster scenario, a quick decision must be made whether a bridge is stable enough to be used. The natural frequencies of a bridge can provide information about its condition. The actual frequencies (e.g. measured by the acceleration sensor built into a smartphone) must be compared with the desired frequencies. The desired frequencies can be approximated for example with the Finite Element Method (FEM).Among other parameters, the FEM requires the dimensions of the bridge. Numerous applications for spatial measurement for different purposes are offered in the mobile App-stores. However, most of these apps are limited to short distances of up to five meters and are not suitable for the aforementioned scenario. In this article, we present NAND-Measure an application for spatial measurements for short distances (below one meter) up to distances of 50 meters. Two methods have been implemented a stereoscopic approach with a single camera and an approach based on the pinhole camera model. Both methods were evaluated by taking sixty over different distances. Overall, the approach based on the pinhole camera model was more accurate and showed smaller deviations.",
aTLAS: a testbed to examine trust for a redecentralized web,"['Valentin Siegert', 'Mahda Noura', 'M.

An application working trustworthy in a decentralized web must evaluate trust and take trustaware decisions autonomously without relying on a centralized infrastructure. This autonomy and the huge amount of available applications necessitates the web to be modelled as an open dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS). To evaluate the trust of web agents, the most suitable trust models need to be identified and used. Despite the various trust models proposed in the literature for evaluating a web agent‚Äôs trust, the examination of them with different scenarios and configurations is not trivial. To address these challenges, we showcase aTLAS, a Trust Laboratory of Multi-Agent Systems which is a web-based wizard testbed for researchers and web engineers to evaluate trust models systematically. aTLAS will enable future research regarding trust evaluations in a decentralized web. We show the different features provided by aTLAS through a set of experiments.",
Natural language goal understanding for smart home environments,"['Mahda Noura', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,0,"One of the main challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to enable end-users without technical experience to use, control or monitor smart devices. However, enabling end-users to interact with these smart devices in an intuitive and natural way becomes increasingly important as they become more pervasive in our homes, workplaces and public environments. Voice-based interfaces are the emerging trend to provide a more natural human-device interaction in smart environments. Such interfaces require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) approaches to identify the meaning of end-users' voice inputs. Designing voice interfaces that are not limited to a small, fixed set of pre-defined commands is far from trivial. Existing voice-based solutions in the smart home domain either restrict the end-users to follow a strict language pattern, do not support indirect goals, require a large training dataset, or need a voice assistant located in the cloud. In this paper, we propose an approach for understanding end-users goals from voice inputs in smart homes. Our approach alleviates the need for end-users to learn or remember concrete operations of the devices and specific words/pattern structures rather it enables them to control their smart homes based on the desired goals (effects). We evaluate the approach through application to a collection of 253 goals from real end-users and report on quality metrics. The results demonstrate that our solution provides a good accuracy, high precision and acceptable recall for understanding end-users goals in the smart home domain.",

VISH: Does Your Smart Home Dialogue System Also Need Training Data?,"['Mahda Noura', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,1,"The main objective of smart homes is to improve the quality of life and comfort of their inhabitants through automation systems and ambient intelligence. Voice-based interaction like dialogue systems is the current emerging trend in these systems. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model can identify the end-users‚Äô intentions in the utterances provided to spoken dialogue systems. The utility of dialogue systems is reliant on the quality of NLU models, which is in turn significantly dependent on the availability of a high-quality and sufficiently large corpus for training, containing diverse utterance structures. However, building such corpora is a complex task even for companies possessing significant human and infrastructure resources. On the other hand, the existing corpora for the smart home domain are either concerned with web services, focus on direct goals only, follow static command structure, or are not publicly available in English language which limits the development of goal-oriented dialogue systems for smart homes. In this paper, we propose a generic method to create training data for the NLU component using a generative grammar-based approach. Our method outputs, Voice Interaction in Smart Home (VISH) dataset consisting of five million unique utterances for the smart home. This dataset can greatly facilitate research in the area of voice-based dialogue systems for smart homes. We evaluate the approach by using VISH to train several state-of-the-art NLU models. Our experiment results demonstrate the capability of the corpus to support the development of goal-oriented voice-based dialogue systems in the context of smart homes.",
I Don‚Äôt Have That Much Data! Reusing User Behavior Models for Websites from Different Domains,"['M. Bakaev', 'Maximilian Speicher', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,1,"User behavior models see increased usage in automated evaluation and design of user interfaces (UIs). Obtaining training data for the models is costly, since it generally requires the involvement of human subjects. For interaction‚Äôs subjective quality parameters, like aesthetic impressions, it is even inevitable. In our paper, we study applicability of trained user behavior models between different domains of websites. We collected subjective assessments of Aesthetics, Complexity and Orderliness from 137 human participants for more than 3000 homepages from 7 domains, and used them to train 21 artificial neural network (ANN) models. The input neurons were 32 quantitative metrics obtained via computer vision-based analysis of the homepages screenshots. Then, we tested how well each ANN model can predict subjective assessments for websites from other domains, and correlated the changes in prediction accuracies with the pairwise distances between the domains. We found that the Complexity scale was rather domain-independent, whereas ‚Äúforeign-domain‚Äù models for Aesthetics and Orderliness had on average greater prediction errors for other domains, by 60% and 45%, respectively. The results of our study provide web designers and engineers with a first framework to assess the reusability and difference in prediction accuracy of the models, for more informed decisions.",

GOWDA: Goal-oriented Web Documents Querying tool,"['Bahareh Zarei', 'M. Gaedke']",2018,0,"Each day, a vast amount of data is published on the web. In addition, the rate at which content is being published is growing, which has the potential to overwhelm users, particularly those who are technically unskilled. Furthermore, users from various domains of expertise face challenges when trying to retrieve the data they require. They may rely on IT experts, but these experts have limited knowledge of individual domains, making data extraction a time-consuming and error-prone task. It would be beneficial if domain experts were able to retrieve needed data and create relatively complex queries on top of web documents. The existing query solutions either are limited to a specific domain or require beginning with a predefined knowledge base or sample ontologies. To address these limitations, we propose a goal-oriented platform that enables users to easily extract data from web documents. This platform enables users to express their goals in natural language, after which the platform elicits the corresponding result type using the algorithm proposed. The platform also applies the concept of ontology to semantically improve search results. To retrieve the most relevant results from web documents, the segments of a user's query are mapped to the entities of the ontology. Two types of ontologies are used: goal ontologies and domain-specific ones, which comprise domain concepts and the relationships among them. In addition, the platform helps domain experts to generate the domain ontologies that will be used to extract data from web documents. Placing ontologies at the center of the approach integrates a level of semantics into the platform, resulting in more-precise output. The main contributions of this research are that it provides a goal-oriented platform for extracting data from web documents and integrates ontology-based development into web-document searches.",

However, as it is still a rather new technology for many users, the cloud represents another layer of complexity in any workflow. As a lot of research confirms, especially the efficient provision and management of resources in the cloud is a very complex but also very rewarding task. Upon surveying the research in this area we observed many differences in applied methodologies and application cases which impede not only the comparison of these approaches but also the collective usage of the obtained results, e.g. for more accurate resource estimation algorithms that require less additional benchmarks. We propose a novel application and resource meta-model to model not only applications but also the underlying resource infrastructure for application benchmarks in a generic manner. We show how the meta-model is defined and how it can be used to model an application, using a simple web application as an example. We conclude with highlighting the potential benefits of applying this model in different scenarios but also its limits and how it could be expanded in the future.",

Persons forming an in-house crowd have to meet for different purposes, such as planning the project or distributing objectives. While scheduling meetings is an important task in a knowledge worker's daily business, the problem evolves by adding more specific constraints to the scheduling. It is difficult for a company that uses an in-house crowd to decide which project can be executed on which date. To deal with this problem we propose the NeLMeSi¬æ≈∫approach. NeLMeSi¬æ≈∫extends the principle of meeting scheduling by defining projects and their required skills as well as persons who have some skills.

Scope-Aware Delegations in Distributed Social Networks,"['A. Scholtz', 'Stefan Wild', 'M.

In such distributed work environments delegations help to solve tasks faster, but also require measures to prevent delegatees from exceeding assigned competencies. By providing universal identification, WebID by W3C can assist in establishing a basis for distributed collaboration. Yet, it does not allow users for delegating access rights to others in a controlled way to act on their behalves. This paper presents the DASC approach to enable scope-aware delegations in distributed social networks using WebID. We introduce a vocabulary to describe delegations including associated constraints and demonstrate a prototypical implementation of DASC within an existing WebID identity provider.",
From TMR to turtle: predicting result relevance from mouse cursor interactions in web search,"['Maximilian Speicher', 'Sebastian Nuck', 'L. Wesemann', 'A. Both', 'M.

Thus, it is necessary to predict the relevance of results a priori. Current solutions mostly engage clicks on results for respective predictions, but research has shown that it is highly beneficial to also consider additional features of user interaction. Nowadays, such interactions are produced in steadily growing amounts by internet users. Processing these amounts calls for streaming-based approaches and incrementally updatable relevance models. We present StreamMyRelevance!--a novel streaming-based system for ensuring quality of ranking in search engines. Our approach provides a complete pipeline from collecting interactions in real-time to processing them incrementally on the server side. We conducted a large-scale evaluation with real-world data from the hotel search domain. Results show that our system yields predictions as good as those of competing state-of-the-art systems, but by design of the underlying framework at higher eciency, robustness, and scalability. 
 
Additionally, our system has been transferred into a real-world industry context. A modified solution called Turtle has been integrated into a new search engine for general web search.

Recent developments like Node.js allow using JavaScript in a simple and efficient way also on the server side, but lack offering a common codebase for the entire Web application. In this article, we present the SWAC approach that aims at reducing development efforts and minimizing coding errors in order to make creating Web applications more efficiently.

Security and Licensing for Components of Web-based Information Systems.,"['M. Gaedke', 'J. Meinecke', 'M. Nussbaumer']",2004,0,"Abstract Modern information systems are increasingly built on Web-based and component-based platforms. This raises the need for a Web-based infrastructure to simplify the management and procurement of corresponding components. Special focus lies on the deployment and distribution of such software artifacts within the context of the World Wide Web to promote their reuse and therefore to save de-velopment costs. At the same time, the integrity of the overall system must not be neglected. The use of components from third-party vendors poses a potential security threat requiring additional care. Furthermore remains the issue of usage rights for the components and the data they provide. Flexi-ble mechanisms can offer a huge range of different licensing models to be enforced on the runtime process. This paper presents an approach to deal with these challenges together with an implemen-tation of a software system supporting component-based Web portals. 1 Introduction Since the beginning, the World Wide Web has dramatically changed the way we access informa-tion. Its growing audience has been supplied with a growing pool of data from a wide range of dif-ferent topics. Being itself a huge information system, it has become the technological fundament for software architectures denoted with the term Web-based information systems. These can take the form of Web portals that act as information access gateways for a global or limited audience. Tech-nically, such portals are Web applications with the primary functionality of searching and display-ing data, possibly originating from databases or Web services. The development of Web applications is a relatively new and in many cases not a very systemati-cally conducted process. Problems related to these issues are covered by the young discipline",
Evolution of Web-Based Applications Using Domain-Specific Markup Languages,"['G. Gr√§f', 'M. Gaedke']",2000,0,"The lifecycle of Web-based applications is characterized by frequent changes to content, user interface, and functionality. Updating content, improving the services provided to users, drives further development of a Web-based application. The major goal for the success of a Web-based application becomes therefore its evolution. Though, development and maintenance of Web-based applications suffers from the underlying document-based implementation model. A disciplined evolution of Web based applications requires the application of software engineering practice for systematic further development and reuse of software artifacts. In this contribution we suggest to adopt the component paradigm to development and evolution of Web-based applications. The approach is based on a dedicated component technology and component-software architecture. It allows abstracting from many technical aspects related to the Web as an application platform by introducing domain specific markup languages. These languages allow the description of services, which represent domain components in our Web-component-software approach. Domain experts with limited knowledge of technical details can therefore describe application functionality and the evolution of orthogonal aspects of the application can be de-coupled. The whole approach is based on XML to achieve the necessary standardization and economic efficiency for the use in real world projects.",
Resource Management in Web-based Business Applications,"['M. Gaedke', 'K. Turowski']",1999,1,"The World Wide Web (WWW, Web) has become a new application platform offering most services needed for a distributed operating system. With this, an opportunity is created that allows fusing originally separated business application systems to support new, value-added business applications accessible via the Web. In this paper, we present an approach to facilitate collaboration of business application systems. In particular, we point out how new Web-based business applications are created by fusing services of ex- isting application systems that may reside in heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, we introduce a means to support inter-application communication on a semantic level, thus providing a global information infrastructure for Web-based business applications that supports resource management.",
Vorgehensmodell und Prozessunterst√ºtzung f√ºr komponentenbasiertes Web Engineering,['Tom-David Graupner'],2010,2,"Der Wettbewerb im Maschinen- und Anlagenbau steht im Zeichen eines Paradigmenwechsels. Die Branche erzielt zwar durch den Verkauf von Investitionsgutern hohe Umsatze; die Gewinne werden jedoch bei vielen durch produktbegleitende Dienstleistungen erzielt. Investitionsguter mit einem hohen Softwareanteil bieten prinzipbedingt eine gute Plattform fur die elektronische Fernerbringung von Dienstleistungen. Internetbasierte Mehrwertdienste konnen auch uber grose Distanzen hinweg in die Zielmarkte exportiert werden. 
Eine Problemstellung in der Gestaltung internetbasierter Mehrwertdienste liegt in den Interdependenzen zwischen einer zu gestaltenden Dienstleistung und der fur die Erbringung notwendigen Informationstechnik. Die Spezifikation einer Dienstleistung hat nicht nur Einfluss auf die Informationstechnik, sondern auch umgekehrt muss die Informationstechnik und IT-Sicherheit bei der Konzeption der Dienstleistungen Berucksichtigung finden. Eine Voraussetzung zur Bundelung verschiedener Mehrwertdienste ist deren Interoperabilitat. Interoperable Mehrwertdienste fur Maschinen und Anlagen stehen allerdings erst am Anfang ihrer Entwicklung. Bisher wurden Mehrwertdienste vorwiegend in Einzelprojekten konzipiert und realisiert. Kundenspezifische Losungen fuhrten zu einer hohen Variantenvielfalt. Durch den Mangel an geeigneten Vorgehensweisen und Plattformstrategien erfolgte die Dienstleistungsentwicklung haufig ineffizient. Die Folge: hoher Aufwand in der Entwicklung und Wartung, zu lange Umsetzungszeitraume sowie qualitativ und technisch nicht ausgereifte Gesamtsysteme. 
Im Rahmen der Dissertation wurde eine Vorgehensweise entwickelt, welche alle relevanten Aspekte von der Ideengenerierung bis zur Inbetriebnahme internetbasierter Mehrwertdienste abdeckt. Das erarbeitete Vorgehensmodell erleichtert die Dienstgestaltung, indem es ein integriertes Vorgehen in Bezug auf die Aspekte des Projektmanagements, des Service Engineerings und des Software Engineerings aufweist. Diese Aspekte werden vor dem Hintergrund der technologischen Moglichkeiten und der etablierten Internetstandards in ein Vorgehensmodell uberfuhrt. Service Engineering und Software Engineering erganzen sich dabei und werden unter dem Begriff E-Service Engineering zusammengefasst. Das Vorgehensmodell ist dabei so allgemeingultig formuliert, dass es fur eine grose Bandbreite internetbasierter Dienstleistungen angewendet werden kann. 
Industrial competition in the mechanical engineering, plant engineering and construction is experiencing paradigm shift. The industry admittedly achieves high revenues through the hardware sales; however, the profits are made through appropriate lucrative services. Modern machinery uses increasingly more electronic system controls. These machines provide a good platform to receive IT-based services. IT-based services can be provided over long distances to international customers of German machine builders. 
A specific problem of such IT-based services is the interdependency between the service and the software which is necessary to deliver the service. Therefore service engineering and software engineering must be synchronized. The delivery of such services presupposes that the development process of software and service is linked. For instance to meet the requirements of IT security. IT system interoperability is an essential precondition to bundle different IT-based services. But we are at the early beginning of the interoperability of such IT-based services. IT-based services and especially the examined value-added-services are presently developed and realized in customer specific projects. This results to a wide variety of different solutions. Lacking suitable procedure models as well as product platform strategies, service development is inefficient and not focused on customer demands. The consequence: each value-added-service must be individually developed resulting in higher costs, more complex maintenance, and long implementation periods between service creation and ramp-up as well as systems which are qualitatively and technically not fully developed. 
The objective of this thesis was to create an integrated procedure model to design and develop web-based value-added services. This model should facilitate the formation of web-based services by simultaneously taking into account project management, service engineering and software engineering. In addition it's necessary to consider both technological possibilities and internet standards. Service engineering and software engineering are summarized under the term E-Service Engineering. The developed procedure is intended to be universal so it can be applied for a broad range of different web-based services.",

What is the knowledge expertise required to build a smart vehicle application (e.g., driver assistance system)? Automotive companies (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Renault) are employing Internet of Things (IoT) and Semantic Web technologies to model the automotive sector. We aggregate this ‚Äúcommon sense knowledge‚Äù in a automotive dataset which comprises 42 semantics-based projects between 2005 and 2019. The knowledge is already encoded with knowledge representation languages (e.g., RDF, RDFS, and OWL) and supported by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, only a subset of those projects share their expertise by publishing their ontologies online. For this reason, at the current time or writing, only 16 ontologies are processable. Our innovative Knowledge Extraction for the Automotive Sector (KEAS) methodology analyzes what are the most popular terms required to build a smart car, it provides: (1) a set of keyphrase that are synonyms to smart cars to find domain-specific knowledge, (2) synonyms are used to build a corpus of scientific publications to train the k-means machine learning algorithm, (3) a dataset of smart car ontologies that we collected, is analyzed by the k-means algorithm, and (4) the extraction of the most common terms from the ontology dataset for the automotive sector. Our KEAS findings can be used as a starting point for further domain-specific investigations (e.g., Volvo willing to integrate semantic web) and for future information extraction from structured knowledge.",
Distributional Ground Truth: Non-Redundant Crowdsourcing Data Quality Control in UI Labeling Tasks,"['M. Bakaev', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,0,"HCI increasingly employs Machine Learning and Image Recognition, in particular for visual analysis of user interfaces (UIs). A popular way for obtaining human-labeled training data is Crowdsourcing, typically using the quality control methods ground truth and majority consensus, which necessitate redundancy in the outcome. In our paper we propose a non-redundant method for prediction of crowdworkers‚Äô output quality in web UI labeling tasks, based on homogeneity of distributions assessed with two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Using a dataset of about 500 screenshots with over 74,000 UI elements located and classified by 11 trusted labelers and 298 Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers, we demonstrate the advantage of our approach over the baseline model based on mean Time-on-Task. Exploring different dataset partitions, we show that with the trusted set size of 17-27% UIs our ‚Äúdistributional ground truth‚Äù model can achieve R2s of over 0.8 and help to obviate the ancillary work effort and expenses.",

DISCO: WEB SERVICE DISCOVERY CHATBOT.,"['Bahareh Zarei', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,0,"An increasing number of companies offer their capabilities as Web services and publish them through public registries. Such Web services enable users to access and manipulate online data programmatically. Moreover, they can be deployed in service-based systems (SBS) or composite web applications and mashups to offer value-added services. A crucial step in deploying Web services is the Web service Discovery. Selecting the best Web service candidates to address the needs of service requesters (e.g., SBS designers) is an important task in SBSs and can influence the quality of the resulting composite web application. So far proposed solutions for addressing this challenge, which are mainly categorized into Syntactic-based and Semantic-based, are either too complex for end-users which hinders their large-scale adaptation or suffer from low precision and recall. Considering the recent trend of shifting the development activities more and more towards the end-users, we propose an approach based on chat-bot technology to allow end-users to select a set of best-fitting Web services according to their goals. Conversational Interfaces also known as chatbots aim at providing users a more natural framework to interact with web applications and devices. The advantage of DISCO compared to the state-of-the-art approaches is leveraging the natural language as the communication medium and alleviating the need for end-users to have technical knowledge about the service‚Äôs structure and location. We conducted sets of experiments by recruiting 8 test subjects to query the chatbot. The results achieve high precision and recall.",
ENHANCING FAKE PRODUCT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING OBJECT DETECTION MODELS,"['Eduard Daoud', 'D. Vu', 'Hung Nguyen', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,0,"ResearchAndMarkets wrote in their report on May 15, 2018, that up to 1.2 Trillion USD in 2017 of products are counterfeited goods. The report estimated this damage globally at 1.82 Trillion USD in 2020. This paper does not consider copyright infringement, digital piracy, counterfeiting or fraudulent documents, but rather examines the prevention of counterfeiting on a technological basis. The presence of counterfeit products on the European and US markets increase, the intervention of inspection bodies and authorities alone is obviously not sufficient, but consumers could make their contribution and improve the situation. In this paper, we research the possibility to reduce counterfeit products using machine learning-based technology. Image and text recognition, and classification based on machine learning have the potential to become the key technology in the fight against counterfeiting. Image recognition and classification of product information empowers the end customer to identify counterfeits accurately and efficiently by comparing them with trained models. The goal of this paper is to create an easy, simple, and elegant application, which empowers the end-users to identify counterfeit products and as such contribute to the fight against product piracy.",
Auto-Extraction and Integration of Metrics forWeb User Interfaces,"['Maxim Bakaev', 'Sebastian Heil', 'V. Khvorostov', 'M.

In our paper, we describe a visual analysis tool which takes a WUI screenshot and produces structured and machine-readable representation (JSON) of the interface elements‚Äô spatial allocation. The implementation is based on OpenCV (image recognition functions), dlib (trained detector for the elements‚Äô classification), and Tesseract (label and content text recognition). The JSON representation is used to automatically calculate several metrics related to visual complexity, which is known to have major effect on user experience with UIs. We further describe a WUI measurement platform that allows integration of the currently dispersed sets of metrics from different providers and demonstrate the platform‚Äôs use with several remote services.

MPCC: Generic Secure Multi-Party Computation in Centralized Cloud-based Environments,"['Philip Kaiser', 'Andr√© Langer', 'M. Gaedke']",2019,0,"Comparing business KPIs with other market participants through benchmarking is a means for companies to optimize costs. Those collaborative optimizations require data of all participating actors that might include business secrets and, therefore, must be kept private in many cases. This demonstrates the demand for privacy-preserving Big Data analytics. Over the last decades, a variety of mechanisms and protocols that enable privacy-preserving collaborative computations have been presented such as trusted third party (TTP) approaches or secure multi-party computation (MPC). However, existing solutions for privacy-preserving benchmarking often only compute a fixed set of arithmetic functions and usually follow a decentralized communication scheme among all peers. We will instead investigate a generic secure MPC system that (1) can compute more general functions, (2) discuss benefits of a service-provider oriented centralized setup and (3) determine the class of arithmetic functions that the selected secure computation mechanism can compute feasibly in practice.
 Our solution proposes an architecture that can calculate functions containing an arbitrary number of additions, subtractions and multiplications, which is capable to operate in scalable cloud environments with also a larger number of peers with the objective to deliver computation results within 24 hours.",

Intelligent End User Development Platform Towards Enhanced Decision-Making,"['Bahareh Zarei', 'M. Gaedke']",2017,0,"From a decision-making perspective, the web is an emerging information domain. It makes a large amount of data available for a large group of users in different domains. In recent years, the dramatic growth of data accessible through the web and the development of large-scale distributed web services have presented new challenges for users. Web services generate data in an ad hoc manner; hence, the systematic management of data has become an obstacle for efficient decision making. On the other hand, the emergence of IoT devices exaggerates the data production rate. Therefore, due to the overwhelming amount of data online, it is essential to support end users, who have limited knowledge of programming, in accessing the relevant information. During the last few decades, many approaches have been proposed to collect and process heterogeneous data from distributed sources in a more uniform way. However, existing solutions have failed to provide the flexibility required for data integration and management. The goal of this project is providing a systematic approach for end users to access and analyze exact data at the right time. The goal of this PhD project is to support knowledge workers in decision making with an end user development approach.",

Utilizing Linked Data Structures for Social-aware Search Applications,"['Andr√© Langer', 'M. Krug', 'Luis Moreno', 'M. Gaedke']",2017,1,"Improving the user experience and conversion rate by means of personalization is of major importance for modern e-commerce applications. Several publications in the past have already dealt with the topic of adaptive search result ranking and appropriate ranking metrics. Newer approaches also took personalized ranking attributes of a connected Social Web platform into account to form so called Social Commerce Applications. However, these approaches were often limited to data silos of closed-platform data providers and none of the contributions discussed the benefits of Linked Data in building social-aware e-commerce applications so far. Therefore, we present a first formalization of a scoring model for a social-aware search approach that takes user interaction from multiple social networks into account. In contrast to other existing solutions, our approach focuses on a Linked Data information management in order to easily combine social data from different social networks. We analyze the possible influence of friend activities to the relevance of a person‚Äôs search intent and how it can be combined with other ranking factors in a formalized scoring model. As a result, we implement a first demonstrator built upon RDF data to show how an application can present the user an adaptive search result list depending on the users‚Äô current social context.",

That is, encryption and decryption must be done by the client and it must be ensured that the cloud provider cannot access any e-Health record. Since a lot of e-Health records can be stored in such a system, it must be possible to search on the encrypted data without revealing any meta data or the records themselves.

Due to differences in manageable user attributes and the authentication protocols as such, the identity concepts are incompatible to each other. With more than one identity concept in use, users need to remember or keep further credentials. In this paper we therefore propose the B3IDS approach. It aims at improving the user experience and the adoption of WebID by building bridges between diverse identity concepts with WebID.

The most common problem is that mashups offer a high grade of personalization, such as the user‚Äôs choice which widgets she wants to use. This problem becomes more difficult in multi-screen mashups, because the user has to decide additionally on which screen the widgets should run. In our recent work we focused on creating multi-screen mashups for enriching multimedia content. That is, a user can watch a video on one screen and also can consume additional content, like a Google Maps excerpt, on another one. This paper presents an approach for rule-based adaption of multi-screen mashups to ease the access for novice users. Therefore, we analyze the users‚Äô interaction with the mashup and detect patterns.

Although principally used for exploring emotional dimension of users‚Äô experience with products, KE can be extended to incorporate other types of software requirements. In conjunction with AI Neural Networks (Kansei Type II), it then becomes possible to automate, up to a certain degree, evaluation of website quality in terms of functionality, usability, and appeal. We provide an overview of existing works related to KE application in web design, and note its certain gap with systematic Web Engineering. Then we summarize approaches for auto-validation of different types of requirements, with particular focus on computer-aided usability evaluation. Finally, we describe the ongoing experimental study we undertook with 82 participants, in which a Kansei-based survey with 21 university websites was performed, and outline preliminary results and prospects.",

It will attempt to strongly engage with the issue of whether Web Engineering is currently, and (more saliently) should be in the future, viewed primarily as a technical design discipline with its attention firmly on the way in which Web technologies can be leveraged in the design process, or whether it should be viewed primarily as a socio-positioned discipline which focuses on the nature of the way in which projects are managed, needs are understood and users interact.",

Web Content Delivery to Heterogeneous Mobile,"['M. Gaedke', 'M. Beigl', 'H.

As emerging mobile platforms such as different kinds of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) tend to vary largely in their capabilities, we suggest that adaptation should be platform-specific. Common approaches for content adaptation are automated conversion and explicit specification of adapted content, with a trade-off between quality and development/maintenance effort. As alternative avoiding this trade-off, we propose a simple object-oriented framework for content adaptation. To facilitate the use of this framework in the Web, we base our approach on the object-oriented WebComposition model and its XML-based implementation WCML. We apply our object-oriented approach to an example application to demonstrate how object-oriented specification of platform-adapted content reduces development/maintenance effort.",
Applying Scalable Distributed Data Structures to Tuple Spaces,"['P. Obreiter', 'G. Gr√§f', 'M. Gaedke']",2002,0,"1 Distributed Tuple Spaces Tuple spaces have been conceived [3] and extended under the influence of databases and messaging systems. However, there is no notion of data schemes, and queries are specified by templates, that may wildcard arbitrary fields of a tuple. Therefore, indexing tuples is a highly non trivial task, which is complicated even more by the advent of field hierarchies. As a result, the need of multi-dimensional indexing and range queries becomes apparent. The transformation of an arbitrary field to an interval, as introduced in [5], induces the transformation of a tuple to a hypercube. Since templates are syntactically identical with tuples, this transformation applies to templates, too. Based on this abstract representation, a necessary condition for matching is deduced, i.e. the inclusion of a tuple's hypercube within the template's hypercube. Furthermore, tuples have to be distributed among several tuple space servers, in order to achieve a scalable tuple space. Therefore, each server is assigned a hypercube, which induces its tuple domain, i.e. the set of tuples with hypercubes that have a non null intersection with the server's hypercube. If a tuple is written to the tuple space, it is stored on an arbitrary server, the tuple domain of which including the tuple. Then, queries may be confined to the subset of servers with tuple domains that include the template.",
Web engineering: introduction to minitrack,"['M. Gaedke', 'D. Schwabe', 'G. Rossi', 'H. Gellersen']",2000,2,"The Web has evolved into a global environment addressing all kinds of application delivery, ranging from small-scale and short-lived services to large-scale, enterprise workflow systems distributed over many servers. The design, implementation, maintenance respectively evolution, and federation of such Web applications requires the application of software engineering practice, specifically as the life-cycle of Web applications is dramatically influenced by arising technologies, user-behavior, and state-of-the-art trends in electronic commerce. Nevertheless most of today's Web application development is still ad-hoc, which may result from the Web's legacy as a coarse-grained, document-centric information system rather than an application platform. Furthermore, the navigational metaphor intrinsic to the Web opens up new ways of managing huge information spaces, and the way users interact with applications to perform a task. Because the Web implementation model does not relate well to state-of-the-art software development models, it is rather difficult to define frameworks that enable the construction of Web Information System applications, reuse design knowledge captured in design patterns, or bridge the gap between a design model and the Web implementation model. This problematic was recently referred to as Web Crisis indicating that the lack of a structured approach will restrict the process of developing or federating more complex systems in the Web relating to cost reduction and quality improvement. In the recent years, this ‚Äúwebexperience‚Äù in the Hypermedia and Web community evolved into a new discipline called Web Engineering. Thus, Web Engineering focuses on the evolution of a profound engineering process and dedicated technologies, methods, and models for the development and maintenance of Web-applications. The Minitrack consists of five papers that cover a broad range of aspects concerning Web Engineering: In ‚ÄúTowards a Relationship Navigation Analysis‚Äù Yoonhee Yoo and Michael Bieber discuss the importance for determining the relationships within conceptual domains or implementations. Thus, they introduce the Relationship Navigation Analysis for system analysis, which is based on a generic relationship taxonomy and provides a systematic way of identifying useful relationships in application domains. German and Cowan investigate many design patterns of the Web community in ‚ÄúTowards a unified catalog of hypermedia design patterns‚Äù. They analyze the vocabularies and taxonomies of design patterns for the Web that are in use today and propose to rewrite the patterns using a uniform vocabulary. Markus Schranz, Johannes Weidl, and Stefan Zechmeister argue in ‚ÄúEngineering Complex World Wide Web Services with JESSICA and UML‚Äù that complex Web services are comparable to large software systems. Therefore, the management and engineering process requires dedicated methodologies and processes. The authors introduce the use of the object-oriented language JESSICA and its support by the Uniform Modeling Language UML. They demonstrate the use of the engineering system with a real world application. In their paper ‚ÄúA Schema-Based Approach to Web Engineering‚Äù Christoph Kuhnke, Andreas Turk, and Josef Schneeberger present a tool that supports their process model for publishing. They suggest the separation of content, layout, navigation, and structure for Document Engineering. This discipline focuses on document design, authoring, and production, and is seen as a methodology of Web Engineering. In ‚ÄúUsing Finite State Machines as Design and Engineering Model for Database Backed Web Applications‚Äù Karl M. G√∂schka and J√ºrgen Falb examine the use of hyperlink for user interaction with relational databases. They present an approach using finite state machines as basis for modelling dynamically generated hyperlinks, which in turn are used to interact with databases.

Yet we would argue that not everything changes but that a large proportion of design decisions are of lasting quality. We propose that such design decision be captured explicitly through complimentary use of design patterns in design methods, and illustrate this with the use of patterns in the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method (OOHDM). Further, we propose the use of an object-oriented web implementation technology, the WebComposition Markup Language (WCML), to facilitate straightforward mapping of object-oriented design patterns to an implementation, and so to facilitate the tracking of higher-level design decisions in a web implementation.",

As a direct consequence, navigation information is not sufficient for the variety of all users. By combining and evaluating user requirements and data models for indoor representation, five categories of indoor navigation information were compiled. OpenStreetMap (OSM) serves as a basis to form items for an online survey for able-bodied, visually and motorically impaired people. Based on the results, we determined: User groups are an important element in indoor navigation. Individual preferences and time dependence of information need to be considered additionally. These results are then used to derive implications for several stages and components in the technological development process. We argue that following these implications by including user requirements in these processes will lead to a higher satisfaction with Indoor Navigation Systems for all users.",

VISH: Does Your Smart Home Dialogue System Also Need Training Data?,"['Mahda Noura', 'Sebastian Heil', 'M. Gaedke']",2020,1,"The main objective of smart homes is to improve the quality of life and comfort of their inhabitants through automation systems and ambient intelligence. Voice-based interaction like dialogue systems is the current emerging trend in these systems. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model can identify the end-users‚Äô intentions in the utterances provided to spoken dialogue systems. The utility of dialogue systems is reliant on the quality of NLU models, which is in turn significantly dependent on the availability of a high-quality and sufficiently large corpus for training, containing diverse utterance structures. However, building such corpora is a complex task even for companies possessing significant human and infrastructure resources. On the other hand, the existing corpora for the smart home domain are either concerned with web services, focus on direct goals only, follow static command structure, or are not publicly available in English language which limits the development of goal-oriented dialogue systems for smart homes. In this paper, we propose a generic method to create training data for the NLU component using a generative grammar-based approach. Our method outputs, Voice Interaction in Smart Home (VISH) dataset consisting of five million unique utterances for the smart home. This dataset can greatly facilitate research in the area of voice-based dialogue systems for smart homes. We evaluate the approach by using VISH to train several state-of-the-art NLU models. Our experiment results demonstrate the capability of the corpus to support the development of goal-oriented voice-based dialogue systems in the context of smart homes.",

EVOLVING WEB APPLICATIONS THROUGH COMPONENT BASED DOMAIN ENGINEERING,"['Guntram Graef', 'M. Gaedke']",2000,0,"From a software-engineering perspective the World Wide Web is a new application platform. The underlying implementation model of the Web complicates the development and even more the evolution of Web applications. The fact that the Web is a highly dynamic and innovative environment suggests that the advantages of component-based software development can be very useful for the development and evolution of Web applications, but such an approach requires dedicated support. The architecture suggested in this contribution addresses this issue by supporting the component-based development and evolution of Web applications. Furthermore by introducing domain specific markup languages for the description of Web-services a mechanism is introduced that makes it possible to abstract from many technical aspects related to the Web as an application platform. Thus application functionality can be described by domain experts with limited knowledge of technical details and the evolution of orthogonal aspects of the application can be decoupled. The whole approach is based on XML-technology to achieve the necessary flexibility and economic efficiency for the use in real world projects by using widely available standard tools.",

eGSSN-2012 Organizing and Program Committees,['J. A. Calero'],2012,0,"Welcome to eGSSN-2012! This is the 2012 International Workshop on Trust, Security and Privacy in e-Government, e-Systems & Social Networking (eGSSN-2012), being held in conjunction with TrustCom-2012 on 25-27 June, 2012 in Liverpool, UK. Electronic systems (e-Systems) have increased tremendously in recent years. Clear examples of e-Systems include e-Commerce, e-Learning systems, e-Health, e-Government systems and social networks. The incredibly amount of people using these systems make them more vulnerable to receive a great diversity of attacks such as denial of service, hijacking, spoofing, man in the middle, etc. Moreover, the information sensible usually managed in e-Systems is another reason for receiving attacks intensively. This workshop aims to identify and explore different issues and challenges related to security aspects in e-Systems in general and specially in e-Government and social networking. Questions like ‚Ä¶ how to preserve privacy and anonymity in social network? How to provide a secure authentication for e-Government? What is a suitable trust model for e-Systems? How to federate social networks? How e-Government may manage risk? ‚Ä¶are those waiting for answers. All manuscripts submitted to eGSSN-2012 underwent a rigorous peer review process to ensure that accepted papers are of high quality. Specifically, each submission was reviewed by at least three referees from the technical program committee. The manuscripts were then ranked according to their original contribution, technical strength, presentation, and relevance to the main theme of the workshop. Finally, 6 papers were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the conference proceedings. We are very grateful to the TrustCom-2012 Organizing Committee for giving us this opportunity to organize eGSSN-2012. We deeply appreciate the Steering Committee for their valuable advice and continued support. Our thanks also go to the authors for their great contributions and to all Program Committee members for providing timely and in-depth reviews. Last but not least, we thank the attendees of this workshop and hope you will enjoy the program.",
Program Chair (s)-Academic Track,"['A. Nowalk', 'Jackie Ho', 'J. Brown']",2019,1,"Background Curricula for pediatric scientist development are not standardized in pediatric residency and fellowship, despite the dire need for pediatric physician scientists. We examined existing educational models and developed an integrated residency/fellowship pediatric scientist training program (PedSDP). Objective Our primary objective was the development of an integrated six-year program, spanning residency and fellowship, for training of pediatric physician scientists. Methods We reviewed 20 existing pediatric residency tracks for scientist development. An integrated six-year program was constructed using the non-standard American Board of Pediatric pathways (Accelerated and Integrated Research Pathways) and individual components modeled on programs from other residencies. We formed a steering committee comprised of departmental leadership to support and provide input into our curriculum development. With the support of the Chair, we were able obtain approval for acceptance into fellowship programs at time of residency selection as a key obstacle to overcome. We also developed internal educational activities to support scientist development. (See Figure for overall design) Results From 2014-2018, our PedSDP recruited 8 residents, improving our overall MD PhD recruitment to 3 per year. While six of eight PedSDP trainees were MD PhD, we also recruited two MD only residents into our program. Residents have pursued fellowship in Infectious Disease and Allergy/Immunology (2 each), and Neonatology, Rheumatology, Critical Care Medicine and Cardiology (1 each). All residents have average milestones in the top half of their class. Discussion We successfully implemented a training program which has increased both MD PhD recruitment but also has provided opportunity for MD residents to pursue research careers. We have found new strategies for recruitment (adding a dedicated ERAS track) but continue to struggle to identify and attract MD/DO only resident applicants interested in being physician-scientists to the program.

Public organisations often face knowledge problems due tothe continual and pervasive movement of staÔ¨Ä between units and de-partment. The Pellucid project is developing a knowledge managementsystem to assist in such situations. This paper describes the knowledgeengineering and the knowledge level modelling undertaken in Pellucid.We use CommonKADS task templates as a mechanism to identify andderive knowledge-intensive tasks related to mobility in public organisations. Assistance to employees in those tasks is provided by active hints,a conveyor of experience within an organisation.Keywords: Experience Management, E-Government, CommonKADS.",

Crossing the Gap,"['Eugene Valassakis', 'Zihan Ding', 'Edward Johns']",2020,19,"Zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of tasks with complex dynamics is a highly challenging and unsolved problem. A number of solutions have been proposed in recent years, but we have found that many works do not present a thorough evaluation in the real world, or underplay the significant engineering effort and task-specific fine tuning that is required to achieve the published results. In this paper, we dive deeper into the sim-to-real transfer challenge, investigate why this is such a difficult problem, and present objective evaluations of a number of transfer methods across a range of real-world tasks. Surprisingly, we found that a method which simply injects random forces into the simulation performs just as well as more complex methods, such as those which randomise the simulator‚Äôs dynamics parameters, or adapt a policy online using recurrent network architectures.",
